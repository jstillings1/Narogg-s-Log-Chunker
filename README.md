This software takes an EverQuest log file and chunks it into 25 meg files, while leaving the source file intact.
This was orginally a VS 2012 project and over time my backup my pc skills failed and I had to recreate it.
This is now a UWP program that is in the works. UWP uses different control set then windows forms did that the original was created in. Stay tuned. I will probably upload this as a blank UWP and just show iterations.

Enjoy
